# Mixamo LLM Mocap

**Turn any locked-camera video — filmed or AI-generated — into a clean
FK animation on any Mixamo character. One performer, or two fighting
each other. No mocap suit, no manual keyframing, and every stage
scriptable enough that an AI agent can run the whole loop.**

*Left: AI-generated source video. Right: the automatic retarget on a
Mixamo character in Blender — 10 seconds, nine punches, a slip under
and a high side kick, straight through the pipeline.*

![showcase — two fighters](media/showcase_duel.gif)

*Two performers, one plate, one pass. The left fighter throws four
punches and a roundhouse; the right one blocks, folds over the body
shot and ducks under the kick. Both tracks are split out of the same
video by screen side, retargeted onto two Mixamo characters with
different proportions — Y Bot and Ninja — and placed at the distance
the performers actually stood, measured from the footage.*

## How it works

```
video plate (locked camera, T-pose bookends)
   │
   ├─ 1. estimate_pose_gvhmr.py    GVHMR (SMPL-X mesh recovery) → 33 landmarks + pelvis height
   ├─ 2. analyze_landmarks.py     numeric beat detection → you write a beat sheet from NUMBERS
   ├─ 3. action_specs/<name>.json  the motion as data: support schedule, rest blends, fists
   ├─ 4. lift_to_mixamo.py         direction-preserving retarget onto YOUR rig's proportions
   ├─ 5. apply_mixamo_fk.py        FK aim + foot planting, inside live Blender (via Blender MCP)
   ├─ 6. qa_clip.py                automated gate: no explosions, no pops, no foot skate
   ├─ 7. compare_reference.py      frame-by-frame vs the video → which windows still differ
   ├─ 8. compare_pair.py           two-character plates: separation, reach, intrusion
   ├─ 9. run_in_blender.py contact real mesh-vs-mesh collision between two characters
   └─ 10. render_preview.py        preview + side-by-side showcase video
```

With two performers in the plate, stages 1–7 run once per fighter
(`--person left|right` splits the tracks), `setup_duo.py` builds one
scene holding both characters, and `compare_pair.py` checks what only
exists when there are two of them: whether they stand, reach and miss
each other the way the performers did.

The estimator provides mesh-quality joints; the lift keeps its segment
*directions* but rebuilds every position from your character's measured
bone lengths; the apply plants feet by solving hip height (never IK —
Mixamo rigs are FK-only); the spec contributes only what a video cannot
know: which foot is the support in each phase (including `"none"` for
airborne beats), when fists close, where the clip locks back to rest.

## Why it's different

- **Any Mixamo character.** `setup_rig.py` builds a clean scene from
  your own Mixamo download and measures it into `rig_profile.json`
  (rest pose, bone lengths, hip and ground heights). Every stage reads
  that profile.
- **Motions are data, not code.** A new motion is a small JSON spec —
  the `action_specs/` here (a kung-fu form, a combo with a jump, a
  fight combination, a 360° jumping spin kick and a two-fighter duel)
  are worked examples of the whole schema.
- **Honest Mixamo FK.** Hips are the only translating bone, everything
  else is quaternions at 30 fps — clips drop into any Mixamo-style
  workflow without cleanup.
- **Real ground contact.** Planted feet solve to ground height with
  zero skate (the support ankle is pinned through each stance); jumps
  integrate the estimator's real pelvis arc.
- **A QA gate, not vibes.** Exploded bones, hip pops, foot skate,
  drifting roots and broken rest poses are caught numerically before a
  human ever looks.
- **A closed refinement loop.** `compare_reference.py` measures the
  retarget against the source video frame by frame on what an eye
  actually reads — hand height relative to the face, distance between
  the hands, limbs inside the torso, gaze direction — and reports the
  exact frame windows that diverge. Notes like *"his hands are too high
  and his arm clips his back"* become numbers, and an over-correction
  gets caught before it ships instead of after.
- **Two characters, one scene.** A two-performer plate is split into
  tracks by which side of frame each occupies — robust where tracker
  ids swap on contact — retargeted onto two different Mixamo characters
  with their own measured proportions, and placed at the distance the
  performers actually stood, recovered from the footage rather than
  eyeballed. `compare_pair.py` then verifies separation, strike reach
  and limb intrusion against the video, frame by frame, and a Blender
  BVH pass checks the actual skinned meshes for collision — because two
  Mixamo characters are thicker than two humans, and a choreography
  built out of 2 cm near-misses collides when you retarget it faithfully.
  Clearance is bought from the stage with a declared, measured offset,
  which the comparator keeps reporting so the cost stays visible.
- **A review pass that is part of the loop.** Render the showcase,
  put source and retarget side by side at the same beat, name what
  looks wrong in one sentence, then measure it. When eye and numbers
  disagree it is usually the numbers — every false reading in this
  project came from a mismatched proxy (a nose against a skull-base
  joint, a capsule against a mesh). [docs/PIPELINE.md](docs/PIPELINE.md)
  section 10.
- **Written for agents.** Beat decisions come from
  `analyze_landmarks.py` numbers (never from eyeballing frames), every
  stage is a CLI or a socket call, and `docs/PITFALLS.md` encodes every
  mistake so the next operator — human or AI — doesn't repeat them.

## Quickstart

1. **Install** — [docs/INSTALL.md](docs/INSTALL.md) walks through every
   dependency (list below).
2. **Build your rig scene**:

   ```
   blender --background --python pipeline\setup_rig.py -- --fbx ybot.fbx --out ybot_rest.blend
   ```

3. **Run a plate** (Blender open on the scene; plate rules in
   [docs/PROMPTING.md](docs/PROMPTING.md)):

   ```
   tools\GVHMR\.venv\Scripts\python.exe pipeline\estimate_pose_gvhmr.py --video plates\<name>\<name>.mp4 --out plates\<name>\landmarks.json
   tools\GVHMR\.venv\Scripts\python.exe pipeline\analyze_landmarks.py --landmarks plates\<name>\landmarks.json
   # beat sheet → action_specs\<name>.json  (schema: docs/PIPELINE.md)
   tools\GVHMR\.venv\Scripts\python.exe pipeline\lift_to_mixamo.py --spec action_specs\<name>.json
   python pipeline\run_in_blender.py all action_specs\<name>.json
   tools\GVHMR\.venv\Scripts\python.exe pipeline\qa_clip.py --spec action_specs\<name>.json
   tools\GVHMR\.venv\Scripts\python.exe pipeline\compare_reference.py --spec action_specs\<name>.json
   tools\GVHMR\.venv\Scripts\python.exe pipeline\render_preview.py action_specs\<name>.json --showcase
   ```

   `compare_reference.py` tells you which frame windows still differ
   from the video; the last command produces `preview.mp4` and the
   side-by-side `showcase.mp4` — the same format as the demo GIF above.

   Two-performer plates add `--person left|right` to the estimate, one
   spec per fighter, and a `compare_pair.py` run — see
   [docs/PIPELINE.md](docs/PIPELINE.md) section 9.

4. **Iterate** with [docs/PIPELINE.md](docs/PIPELINE.md) and
   [docs/PITFALLS.md](docs/PITFALLS.md).

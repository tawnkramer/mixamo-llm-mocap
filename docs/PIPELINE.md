# The pipeline, operationally

How a video becomes a Y Bot clip, stage by stage, with the decision
rules an operator (human or AI) needs. Everything here was validated on
the two shipped clips.

## 0. The plate (source video)

Quality is won or lost here. Rules (see docs/PROMPTING.md for
generating plates with AI video):

- Locked camera, full body in frame the whole time, even light, 720p+.
- **T-pose held ~1 s at the start AND the end**, facing the camera
  square. The T-poses are the rest anchors; the pipeline blends into
  exact Y Bot rest there.
- One continuous take, on the spot. Every moving limb must stay
  visible — an occluded limb cannot be tracked (it can be fixed with an
  `arm_override`, but only because a human saw the video).
- Facing changes are fine (the kungfu clip turns ±100°); occlusion is
  the enemy, not rotation.

Save as `plates/<name>/<clip>.mp4` with a short `SOURCE.md`.

## 1. Estimate

```
tools\GVHMR\.venv\Scripts\python.exe pipeline\estimate_pose_gvhmr.py ^
    --video plates\<name>\<clip>.mp4 --out plates\<name>\landmarks.json
```

Output: 33 landmarks/frame (MediaPipe-compatible convention: per-frame
mid-hip origin, y down, z **negative toward camera**, meters),
`pelvis_height` (absolute, above the estimator's ground plane) and
`gaze` (unit vector, the performer's real face direction taken from
mesh vertices — nose vs ear midpoint). The face landmarks are real mesh
points, not torso-derived: head orientation cannot be recovered from
joint positions, and a retarget without it can only lock the character's
gaze to its chest.
GVHMR caches its preprocessing under `tools/GVHMR/outputs/demo/<stem>/`
— re-runs are fast.

## 2. Numeric beat sheet — BEFORE any spec

```
tools\GVHMR\.venv\Scripts\python.exe pipeline\analyze_landmarks.py --landmarks plates\<name>\landmarks.json
```

Write `plates/<name>/BEATSHEET.md`: a table of beats with src frame
windows, the acting limb, the support foot, and the *numeric evidence*
(this tool's output). Hard rules:

- **Take every limb decision from the numbers, never from stills.**
  Facing the camera, viewer-left is the character's RIGHT; every
  screen-read limb guess in this project's history was wrong at least
  once. Gen-video also deviates from its prompt (a prompted left-knee
  jump arrived as right-knee).
- Punches: wrist z dips below −0.32 (toward camera). Kicks/knees: one
  ankle height rises with the other grounded. Flight: both ankles
  > 0.25 m. Ducks/jumps: `pelvis_height` dips/peaks.
- Shoulder-line yaw swings ±40–60° during punches without the hips
  turning — don't read those as facing changes.

## 3. The action_spec (the motion as data)

`action_specs/<motion>.json` — all frame numbers are **source** frames
(the lift converts to 30 fps dest internally):

```jsonc
{
  "name": "combo",                          // slug
  "action_name": "YBot_ComboFromVideo",     // Blender action name
  "clip_dir": "clips/ybot_combo_from_video",// outputs (repo-relative)
  "landmarks": "plates/combo/landmarks.json",
  "joints_out": "plates/combo/joints_mixamo.json",
  "estimator": "gvhmr_siga24",
  "src_fps": 24, "dst_fps": 30,

  // Blend into exact Y Bot rest. End is required; start is optional
  // (use it when the plate opens on a clean T-pose).
  "rest_blend_start": { "full_src": 1, "release_src": 16 },
  "rest_blend_end":   { "start_src": 214, "full_src": 232 },

  // Fist amount 0->1->0, smooth edges.
  "fists": { "rise_src": [20, 28], "fall_src": [200, 212] },

  // Optional authored overrides for beats where the human's read of
  // the video beats the estimator (occluded arm etc.). Targets are
  // METERS in the hip basis (x=character left, y=back, z=up), ramped.
  "arm_overrides": [
    { "side": "right", "src": [76, 163], "ramp_src": 6,
      "wrist_local": [-0.17, -0.12, 0.33],
      "elbow_local": [-0.25, 0.05, 0.12] }
  ],

  // The support schedule — the heart of the spec. Windows must cover
  // the clip. Supports: "both", "left", "right", "none" (airborne).
  "plant": [
    { "src": [1, 129],   "support": "both"  },
    { "src": [130, 154], "support": "left"  },   // right leg acts
    { "src": [155, 158], "support": "right" },
    { "src": [159, 168], "support": "none"  },   // flight
    { "src": [169, 177], "support": "left"  },   // landing
    { "src": [178, 241], "support": "both"  }
  ],

  "qa_src_frames": [1, 30, 60, 109, 139, 163, 241]  // beat frames for QA/stills
}
```

`plant`, `rest_blend_start/end`, `fists` and `arm_overrides` can be
authored visually instead of by hand — open `annotator/index.html` (no
build step, no server) to scrub the plate video with its landmarks
overlaid, drag out plant windows on a synced numeric-signals plot, and
correct depth/height directly on a synthetic side view (arm_overrides)
or the plot (a `pelvis_height` keyframe editor, saved back into
landmarks.json — see `docs/MEDIAPIPE_INVESTIGATION.md` for why depth and
jump height are the two things worth a visual editor). See
`annotator/README.md`. `arm_pose`, `reach`, `smooth` and the duel fields
below still get hand-edited in the JSON.

What each support does in the FK apply:
- `left`/`right`: hip height searched so that foot lands at 0.105 m;
  the foot is flattened (Z-only, keeps estimator XZ and its own
  heading); the lift also **pins the support ankle's XZ** for the whole
  window (the pose translates so the planted foot never skates; the
  correction decays over 10 frames after the window).
- `both`: plant the lower foot, flatten both if near ground. Feet may
  genuinely step inside a `both` window — that is fine.
- `none`: no plant, no snapping; hip height integrates the estimator's
  `pelvis_height` arc from the last planted frame (continuous takeoff,
  ballistic flight). Landing pops are caught by QA's hip-step check.
  Two tuning notes from real passes: (a) airborne detection fires only
  once feet clear ~0.25 m, which EATS the launch rise if the window
  starts there — start the `none` window at the true liftoff (watch
  `pelvis_height` start climbing steeply); (b) the estimator tends to
  understate jump amplitude — an optional `"boost": 1.3` on the window
  scales the integrated arc (landing stays continuous because the arc's
  endpoint is scaled too).

An optional top-level `"smooth"` list applies extra windowed
Savitzky-Golay smoothing to selected joints (default: both arm chains)
where fast flurries read staccato:

```jsonc
"smooth": [ { "src": [172, 204], "window": 9 } ]
```

Windowed correctors for systematic estimator bias inside a phase (all
ramped; they leave the rest of the clip untouched):

```jsonc
// Follow the performer's own arm geometry for a beat: the wrist is
// placed at their wrist offset (scaled to this character) and the chain
// re-solved with exact bone lengths. This is the strongest corrector —
// it copies real human geometry, so it cannot self-intersect — and it
// needs no hand-tuned numbers. Anchor "shoulders" (default) keeps the
// anatomy honest; "head" matches hand-to-face height instead, which can
// drive hands into the torso when proportions differ. Use it for any
// beat being judged frame by frame.
"arm_follow": [
  { "src": [140, 202], "ramp_src": 4, "side": "both", "anchor": "shoulders" }
],

// Rotate a whole arm rigidly about its shoulder socket. Targets are in
// METRES and the angle is solved per frame, because a fixed angle over-
// or under-shoots as the arm swings. Rigid rotation preserves elbow
// bend, wrist alignment and the distance between the hands — offsetting
// the joints instead (and re-normalizing bone lengths) collapses the
// hands together and folds the wrists at anything beyond ~2 cm.
"arm_pose": [
  { "src": [138, 206], "ramp_src": 6, "side": "both",
    "drop_m": 0.145,      // + lowers the hands along an arc
    "widen_m": 0.085 }    // + opens the hands apart
  // also accepts raw "pitch_deg" / "yaw_deg" if you prefer angles
],

// Restore strike extension. Scales the hand's distance from its
// shoulder socket along its own direction, then re-places the chain
// with exact bone lengths (current elbow as pole). Only arms already
// past `min_extension` of full length are affected, so guards stay put.
"reach": [
  { "src": [172, 204], "ramp_src": 4, "side": "both",
    "factor": 1.22, "max_fraction": 0.97, "min_extension": 0.30 }
],

// Authored targets for a beat the estimator got wrong (occluded arm).
// Positions in metres in the hip basis (x=left, y=back, z=up).
"arm_overrides": [
  { "side": "right", "src": [76, 163], "ramp_src": 6,
    "wrist_local": [-0.17, -0.12, 0.33], "elbow_local": [-0.25, 0.05, 0.12] }
]
```

**Sizing a correction:** measure, don't guess. Compare the retarget
against the reference on quantities the eye actually reads — hand height
relative to the HEAD, distance between the hands, hand distance from the
chest — and remember to subtract the part that is proportion rather than
pose (a character whose head sits lower on its shoulders will always
read "hands high" at identical joint angles).

### Gaze

The head follows the estimator's real gaze by default — no spec entry
needed. Two top-level knobs tune it:

```jsonc
"gaze_follow": 1.0,          // 0..1, how strongly the head tracks the real gaze
"gaze_max_offset_deg": 70    // cap on head-vs-chest yaw, so a 360 spin
                             // does not twist the neck off
```

Per-window overrides go in `head_look` entries as `"follow_gaze"`, and
the manual correctors remain for the rare case where the estimator's
head is wrong: `"amount"` (blend heading toward character-forward),
`"level_face"` + `"level_target_deg"` (put the face at a fixed elevation
by closed loop on the rig).

`qa_clip.py` audits the result: it flags a head locked to the chest
(gaze-vs-chest std < 2°, the signature of an estimator that isn't
emitting real head orientation) and a head staring upward (mean
elevation > 12°).

**Smoothing eats strikes.** A `smooth` window wide enough to calm a
fast flurry (9 frames) also averages away its extension peaks — the
punches get visibly shorter. Keep flurry windows narrow (5) and
restore amplitude with `reach` rather than widening the smoothing.

## 4. Lift

```
tools\GVHMR\.venv\Scripts\python.exe pipeline\lift_to_mixamo.py --spec action_specs\<motion>.json
```

Direction-preserving retarget: estimator segment directions × Mixamo
bone lengths from the Mixamo sockets. No IK. Read the QA lines it
prints (one per `qa_src_frames`): rest/fist amounts, plant, yaw, key
positions. Sanity: rest frames print the exact Y Bot rest
(`lw=[0.73777, 0.06171, 1.43572]`).

## 5. Apply (inside live Blender)

Blender must be open on `ybot_rest.blend` with the MCP add-on server
running. One command drives all three Blender-side stages:

```
python pipeline\run_in_blender.py all action_specs\<motion>.json
```

(`apply` keys the action — ~2–4 min per 300 frames, Blender's UI
freezes, that's normal; `curves` dumps every bone every frame;
`stills` renders front+side PNGs at the spec's QA frames. Run stages
individually with `apply|curves|stills`.) Agents with MCP can instead
call `apply_mixamo_fk.run/dump_curves/run_stills_render` directly via
`execute_blender_code`.

Stills and previews use a temporary camera + Workbench render
(window-independent); never use viewport screenshots — they capture
black when the Blender window is occluded.

To produce the review videos (`preview.mp4` + the side-by-side
`showcase.mp4` against the source plate):

```
tools\GVHMR\.venv\Scripts\python.exe pipeline\render_preview.py action_specs\<motion>.json --showcase
```

## 6. Compare against the reference (refinement)

```
tools\GVHMR\.venv\Scripts\python.exe pipeline\compare_reference.py --spec action_specs\<motion>.json
... --from-src 130 --to-src 210     limit to a beat
... --detail                        per-frame table
```

QA proves a clip is not broken; this proves it looks like the video. It
measures both on the quantities an eye reads — hand height relative to
the face, distance between the hands, hand distance from the chest,
limbs inside the torso, gaze yaw and elevation — and reports the
**source-frame windows** where they diverge, ready to become spec
entries. Run it after every pass; it catches over-corrections (a fix
that pushes a hand into the body) before a human has to.

Two measurement traps it handles, worth knowing if you extend it:
compare against a FACE proxy (mid-skull), not the head joint, which
sits at the skull base and bakes in a false offset; and report the
character's own head/shoulder proportion separately, so proportion is
never mistaken for pose error.

## 7. QA

```
tools\GVHMR\.venv\Scripts\python.exe pipeline\qa_clip.py --spec action_specs\<motion>.json
```

| Check | Limit | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| world bounds | \|x\|,\|y\| < 2, z ∈ (−0.5, 3) | exploded bones |
| hip Z step | < 0.12 m/frame | pops (takeoff/landing included) |
| in-place travel | end-to-end ≈ 0 | root discipline |
| single-support | z-err ≈ 0, XZ wander ≈ 0 | plant + no skate |
| airborne | lower-foot clearance > 0.12 m | the jump actually flies |
| end frame | hand error < 0.03 vs rest | clean T-pose out |
| frame-jumps | < 0.30 m per bone | teleporting limbs |

`WARN` on a `both` window usually means a genuine step (weight shift,
stance widening) — check the video before "fixing" it. **Numbers can
pass while the motion is wrong: always look at the stills and play the
clip. The human eye is the last word.**

## 8. Iteration protocol (how 16 passes became 1–2)

- Beat sheet before any spec. A wrong limb in the spec is a wasted pass.
- Human notes come as frame ranges + a region ("frames 18–50, punching
  side"). Map the range to the beat and to the spec field that owns it
  BEFORE editing anything.
- One constraint per pass. Never touch a region the human has signed
  off to polish a different one.
- Re-render stills after every apply; never argue from a stale image.
- When the estimator and the human's read of the video disagree, the
  human is right (occlusion, foreshortening) — encode the fix as an
  `arm_override`, don't fight the estimator globally.

## 9. Two characters in one scene

A multi-performer plate is not "run the pipeline twice". Two
individually perfect retargets still fail if the characters stand at
the wrong distance — every punch swings through empty air, or a fist
ends up inside a skull. What changes:

### 9.1 Estimate each performer separately

```
... estimate_pose_gvhmr.py --video plates\duel\duel.mp4 --person left  --out plates\duel\landmarks_grey.json
... estimate_pose_gvhmr.py --video plates\duel\duel.mp4 --person right --out plates\duel\landmarks_white.json
```

`--person left|right|<index>` selects a performer by **which side of
frame they occupy**, not by tracker id. Ids swap when two bodies touch,
and a swap splices half of each performer into one "track"; screen side
is a fact as long as the plate never lets them cross — which is why the
plate contract forbids it (docs/PROMPTING.md). Caches are per person,
so the two runs do not fight over the same preprocessing.

Each landmarks file then carries, besides the solo fields, `root`
(ground trajectory, gravity-aligned frame), `incam_root` and `incam`
(pelvis and all 33 landmarks in CAMERA space).

### 9.2 Build one scene with both characters

```
blender --background --python pipeline\setup_duo.py -- ^
    --char YBot=ybot.fbx --char Ninja=ninja_rest.blend --out duel_rest.blend
```

Each character gets `Armature_<Name>` and its own
`rig_profiles/<name>.json`. Two characters do **not** share a hip
height — planting the Ninja at the Y Bot's ground offset buries its
feet — so every stage now takes the profile from the spec.

Both armature objects stay at the origin. Stage placement is baked into
the animation instead (`stage_x`), because the FK apply aims bones in
armature space and a translated armature object would silently offset
every aim target (docs/RIG.md).

### 9.3 Spec fields a paired clip adds

```jsonc
{
  "armature": "Armature_YBot",              // which character in the scene
  "rig_profile": "rig_profiles/ybot.json",  // its measured proportions

  "root_motion": true,     // keep the performer's travel (see below)
  "root_source": "incam",  // "incam" (default) or "global"
  "root_depth": false,     // include the depth axis too (default: lateral only)
  "stage_x": -0.943,       // where this character stands
  "root_scale": 0.9715,    // ONE stage, ONE scale — shared by both fighters

  "prefilter_window": 5    // landmark prefilter width, source frames (default 7)
}
```

**Root motion.** Solo clips are retargeted in place — Mixamo convention
and correct, since the estimator's landmarks are hip-centred every
frame anyway. Two fighters are the opposite case: the distance between
them *is* the scene. On the duel plate the attacker closed 1.95 m →
0.88 m and back out again; in place, every punch lands a metre short.

Two estimates of that travel exist and they disagree. `global` is the
gravity-aligned world trajectory: physically consistent but *predicted*,
and it drifts (it under-reported that 0.92 m step-in as 0.68 m and left
the performer 0.16 m off his mark at the closing T-pose). `incam` is
tied to what the camera saw and tracked an independent image-space
measurement to within 2 cm across all 241 frames — so it is the
default. Only its lateral component is used; depth is the
ill-conditioned axis of a single-camera fit.

Pinning is skipped when `root_motion` is on. The foot skate it corrects
is an artefact of *discarding* the travel; restore the travel and the
artefact is gone at the source, while re-pinning on top would cancel
each step inside its own stance and snap it back on release.

**Sizing the stage.** Measure the performers' separation at the T-pose
from `incam_root`, scale it by the shared stage scale, and split it
either side of the origin. Then verify with `compare_pair.py` rather
than trusting the arithmetic.

### 9.4 `leg_pose` — the leg's `arm_pose`

```jsonc
"leg_pose": [
  { "src": [142, 150], "ramp_src": 3, "side": "right", "lift_m": 0.18 }
]
```

Rotates a whole leg rigidly about its hip socket so the foot rises (or
drops) by a measured amount, solved per frame. The axis is the
horizontal one perpendicular to the leg itself — a roundhouse and a
front kick travel in different planes, and a fixed lateral axis would
skew one of them sideways.

It exists because the estimator's gravity-aligned pose and its
in-camera pose disagree about a fast limb at its peak, and the retarget
must follow the gravity-aligned one (that is what makes feet plant). On
a head-high roundhouse that showed as a shin ~9° low, dropping the foot
0.15 m — putting it *through* the ducking defender instead of over him.
Size it from `compare_pair.py`, never by eye.

### 9.5 Render and check the pair

```
... render_preview.py action_specs\duel_ybot.json --also action_specs\duel_ninja.json ^
      --out-dir clips\duel --showcase --social
... compare_pair.py --spec action_specs\duel_ybot.json --spec action_specs\duel_ninja.json
```

`--also` binds every character's action before rendering (otherwise one
fighter renders frozen in its T-pose while the other fights it) and
frames the camera from the dumped curves so both stay in shot.

`compare_pair.py` measures the three things neither `qa_clip.py` nor
`compare_reference.py` can see:

| Check | What it catches |
|---|---|
| separation | the pair standing too far apart / too close, per frame |
| reach | a strike that stops short of, or drives past, where it landed in the video |
| intrusion | a limb *inside* the other character — absolute, no reference needed |

It reads both performers in the **camera** frame, re-expressed in a
gravity-aligned basis solved from the data (docs/PITFALLS.md #26–27),
and tests whole limb SEGMENTS, not endpoints.

Run all three: `qa_clip` per character (is it broken?),
`compare_reference` per character (does it look like its performer?),
`compare_pair` once (do the two relate like the two performers did?).

### 9.6 Clearance — the part that has no solo equivalent

Two individually faithful retargets can still be wrong on screen,
because **two Mixamo characters are not two humans**. Their limbs,
heads and hands are thicker, and a fight choreography is built out of
near-misses. On the duel plate the attacker's roundhouse passes the
defender's guard hand 0.111 m centre-to-centre; with real forearms that
is a 2 cm miss, and with these characters' meshes it is a collision.
The retarget reproduced that 0.111 m to the centimetre and was
*therefore* wrong.

**Measure it on the meshes.** The capsule proxies in `compare_pair.py`
are right about separation and reach and optimistic about contact — they
scored this kick as clearing by 4 mm while the meshes intersected over
230 face pairs. Ground truth is the evaluated, skinned geometry:

```
python pipeline\run_in_blender.py contact action_specs\duel_ybot.json ^
       --with action_specs\duel_ninja.json
```

BVH overlap between the two characters, every frame, written to
`<clip_dir>/../pair_contact.json`: intersecting face-pair counts, and
the surface-to-surface gap where they do not intersect. Run it over the
WHOLE clip — restricting it to the beat under repair is how four other
intersections survived two passes here, one of them in the closing
T-pose.

**Then separate intended contact from unintended.** Punches landing on
a block *should* touch; two rigid hands cannot deform, so those frames
show deep overlap and that is the strike landing. Ask what the source
video does at that frame.

**Buy the clearance from the stage, not the poses.** Every pose lever
was tried on this collision and each one moved the problem elsewhere:
raising the kick swept the foot through the guard hand, lowering the
defender dropped his hands into the rising foot, curling his spine swung
his arms forward, leaning him away lifted his head into the arc. Only
distance helped every frame at once. Requirements that flip between
adjacent frames are the signature of a graze no pose fix can satisfy.

```jsonc
"root_offset": [
  { "src": [116, 185], "ramp_src": 23, "dx": -0.20 },   // room for the kick
  { "src": [186, 241], "ramp_src": 18, "dx": -0.07 }    // room for the bind
]
```

A windowed, ramped shift of one character's ground trajectory. Two
rules: ramp it across frames where that character is **already
travelling** (0.20 m applied under a planted foot is 0.20 m of skate —
here it rides the 0.24 m retreat he already makes between the punches
and the kick), and **declare it**, so `compare_pair.py` prints
`[declared root_offset]` next to the separation it causes instead of
reporting it as an unexplained defect. The cost stays visible.

The second window above is a different instance of the same physics:
these characters' arms are ~4% longer relative to their legs than the
performers', so at a leg-scaled stage separation their fingertips cross
while the arms swing out into the closing T-pose. The settled T-poses
were always clear (0.09–0.13 m); only the spread collided.

### 9.7 Order of operations for a paired clip

1. Estimate both performers, write both beat sheets.
2. Size the stage from `incam_root` at the T-pose; lift and apply both.
3. `qa_clip` each — is either clip broken?
4. `compare_reference` each — does each look like its performer?
5. `compare_pair` — do the two relate like the performers did?
6. `run_in_blender.py contact` over the whole clip — do the meshes
   actually touch?
7. Only now reach for clearance, and only for contacts the video does
   not have.

Steps 3–6 answer different questions and none of them substitutes for
another. Step 6 is the one that agrees with a human watching the video.

## 10. The review pass (do not skip this)

Every defect that mattered in this project was found by putting the
source frame and the retargeted frame **side by side at the same beat
and looking at them**, then measuring what the eye flagged. Numbers
alone shipped a foot through a head; an eye alone could not say by how
much or why. The loop is:

1. Render the showcase (`render_preview.py --showcase`).
2. Pull paired crops at the beat frames — source left, retarget right,
   labelled with the source AND destination frame number. A contact
   sheet every ~10 frames for the whole clip, then a tight crop on any
   beat that looks wrong.
3. Name what looks wrong in one sentence, in body terms ("the foot goes
   through his head", "his guard is too narrow").
4. Turn that sentence into a measurement, and only then edit a spec.

**When your eye and your numbers disagree, one of them is measuring the
wrong thing — and it is usually the numbers.** Every time it happened
here the cause was a mismatched proxy: a nose compared to a skull-base
joint, a shoulder line to a Neck joint, limb endpoints instead of whole
segments, a capsule instead of the mesh. Before trusting a number,
name the anatomical point on both sides and check they are the same
one. Before dismissing what a human saw, assume the model is wrong.

This is the whole reason `compare_reference.py`, `compare_pair.py` and
the `contact` stage exist: they turn "his arm clips his back" into a
frame window and a distance in metres, so the fix can be sized instead
of guessed — and so an over-correction is caught on the next run
instead of after it ships.
